# CUDA FORTRAN for Material Scientists

The event has been organized in collaboration with NVIDIA aiming to teach and advocate the usage of CUDA FORTRAN in scientific codes, in particularly in the field of material science. NVIDIA worked with The Portland Group (PGI) to develop a CUDA Fortran Compiler that provides Fortran language support for NVIDIAâ€™s CUDA-enabled GPUs. The compiler is freely available in the "Community Edition"on PGI website.
